# USED-CAR-PRICE-PREDICTIONS
Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
Collected data from Kaggle for this project.We are required to model the price of cars with the available indepedent variales.it will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices of the cars may vary.

There are many types of cars present in this data, our task is to first explore the given data with help of EDA techniques and visualizations by Python
Data is not that big, so it is not necessary to use Neural Networks but for practicing ANN, I used Neural Networks.
This a regression problem so you can use Linear Regression, XG Boost Regressor.
